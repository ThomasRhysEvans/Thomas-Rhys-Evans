Hello! My name is Tom (he/him/his) and I am an Associate Professor in Occupational Psychology at the University of Greenwich, UK. I am also a Chartered Psychologist, Fellow of the Higher Education Academy and Co-Editor-In-Chief of the Journal of Open Psychology Data.

My early research profile focussed upon a variety of themes surrounding the affective and social aspects of our working lives, leading projects on humour, emotional intelligence, feedback, and frustration. I currently focus upon using meta-psychology and open science practices to understand the quality of evidence within Occupational Psychology, and Psychology more broadly. I work with a number of industry partners, and have published a book on the application of Occupational Psychology to the Fire Service. 

I particularly enjoy adopting a collaborative and critical approach to addressing big societal issues and welcome opportunities to collaborate with researchers, practitioners and industry partners on such goals.
