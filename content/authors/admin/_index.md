Dr Thomas Rhys Evans is an Associate Professor in Occupational Psychology at the University of Greenwich, UK. 

Tom’s early research profile focussed upon a variety of themes surrounding the affective and social aspects of our working lives, leading projects on humour, emotional intelligence, feedback, and frustration. Tom’s research currently focuses upon using meta-psychology and open science practices to understand the quality of evidence within Occupational Psychology, and Psychology more broadly. Tom has a background of applying Occupational Psychology to the Fire Service context, and particularly enjoys adopting a collaborative and critical approach to addressing big societal issues.
