Hello! My name is Tom (he/him/his) and I am a Professor in Occupational Psychology and Open Scholarship at the University of Greenwich, UK. I am also a Chartered Psychologist, Principal Fellow of the Higher Education Academy and Co-Editor-In-Chief of the Journal of Open Psychology Data.

Whilst my ‘home’ is within Occupational Psychology, in which I am passionate about challenging corruption, climate change, and inequalities, my research has also focused upon improving the teaching and research practices behind the research that impacts our society. I have found this meta-research and open science reform a rewarding gateway to influencing research and  policy across disciplines and geographical boundaries.

I particularly enjoy adopting a collaborative and critical approach to addressing big societal issues and welcome opportunities to collaborate with researchers, practitioners and industry partners on such goals.
